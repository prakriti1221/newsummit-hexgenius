# Smart Parking System
## Description
The Smart Parking System is an innovative project that aims to revolutionize the traditional parking experience in urban areas. It leverages modern technologies to create a seamless, efficient, and user-friendly parking solution. The system addresses the challenges of parking congestion and time wastage by providing real-time data, advanced reservations, and automated payment processes. 

## Components
The Smart Parking System consists of three main components:
- **Central Server:** The central server is the core of the system, responsible for collecting, processing, and storing data received on the app. It acts as a centralized hub for all real time parking-related information.
 - **Mobile Application:** A user-friendly mobile application allows drivers to access real-time parking availability, make reservations, check available space,  and even pay parking fees through various payment methods.
 - **Database:** A secure and scalable database stores all historical and real-time data, including parking spot availability, user profiles, and transaction records.

## Tech Stack 
- **Frontend:** React Native
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js

## Features
- **Real-Time Parking Availability:** Using the mobile app, drivers can check the availability of parking spots in real time. The system displays the number of vacant spots in each section of the parking lot.
- **Reservation System:** Drivers can reserve a parking spot in advance through the app or website. This feature ensures they have a guaranteed parking space upon arrival, saving time and reducing frustration.
- **Navigation and Guidance:** The app offers navigation assistance to guide drivers to the nearest available parking spot, reducing unnecessary driving.
- **Automated Payment:** The system allows drivers to pay parking fees through the app using various payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and mobile wallets. This feature eliminates the need for cash payments and reduces the time spent at the parking lot.
- **Data Analytics and Reporting:** The system collects and analyzes data on parking usage, peak hours, and trends, providing valuable insights for parking lot owners and city planners to optimize parking spaces and make informed decisions.

## Originality 
- **Pre-reservation:** Our system offers a pre-reservation feature that allows users to book parking spots in advance through the mobile app. It guarantees parking space before arriving at the parking lot.
- **Reward System:**  When drivers use a smart parking system to make reservations or payments, they earn reward points. After each use, you get 10 points as a reward. After accumulating 50 reward points user can use these reward points to get one free parking offer. 50 points equals to 1 free parking
